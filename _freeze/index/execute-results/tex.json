As many people here will no doubt be already aware, there has existed for some time now a voluminous and highly specialized body of literature on the genre of _film noir_, and on the postwar movement in French film known as the _nouvelle vague_ or New Wave. While I have no pretensions to adding to that literature, its existence does not mean that everything there is to say on these subjects has already been said. Maybe I’ve just been watching too many heist movies lately, but what I am interested in doing is to try---under cover of darkness, obviously---to break open the constrictive generic and auteurist _coffres-forts_ in which cinema has been locked away for decades by introducing a different paradigm that I call _nocturnal cinema_. While the night has figured prominently in cinema from its earliest origins, by nocturnal cinema I am referring to a more specific corpus of films in which night is not just a temporal backdrop for narrative realism but is foregrounded as an aesthetic, thematic, stylistic, and symbolic element in the films in question. The paradigm of nocturnal cinema, I want to suggest, opens up the possibility of conceptualizing alternative histories of cinema that treat it not as a discrete object of study but position it within a broader cultural spectrum of media and artistic practices. As such, it may serve as a prototype for other new ways of thinking about the history of cinema.\n\nWith that said, let us begin, as one must, with Melville.\n\n### Pigalle\n\nThis sequence from _Bob le flambeur_ provides a succinct example of a particular kind of cinematic cultural mythology that was already in place when Melville’s film was released in 1956: a set of associations involving criminal activity, music, and the urban night, originating in the cinematic appropriation of popular crime fiction, that in the late 1940s came to be known as _film noir_. The emergence of this mythology in the late-1930s films of Marcel Carné, and over subsequent decades in the films of Jules Dassin, Jacques Becker, Jean-Pierre Melville, Louis Malle, and Édouard Molinaro, followed by the _nouvelle vague_ films of Godard, Truffaut, Chabrol, and others, is the subject both of the present paper and a related project I am currently working on, a cinematic compilation album titled _Ciné-Jazz_.\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/689915059?h=6d37ed9a54&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"320\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n:::\n\nFor reasons of time, I will limit myself here to the work of Édouard Molinaro, which has been overshadowed by the better-known examples of Louis Malle’s celebrated collaboration with Miles Davis on _Ascenseur pour l’échafaud_ (1958), Godard’s _À bout de souffle_ (1960), and others. The series of films released by Molinaro in the late 1950s that includes _Le dos au mur_ (1958), _Des femmes disparaissent_ (1959, and _Un témoin dans la ville_ (1959), embody the cinematic chronotope of urban crime, jazz, and the night. Collectively, they provide a case study in a larger genre that I would like to call _nocturnal cinema_. I want to explore here some of the key characteristics of this nocturnal cinema, as manifested in French _film noir_ and its legacy in the _nouvelle vague_ or New Wave.\n\n### Nuits Monochromes\n\nAs a quintessentially nocturnal experience of urban modernity, cinema is almost organically related to the night; as Luc Gwiazdzinski has observed,\n\n> Du noir de la pellicule à l’obscurité de ses salles, le cinéma entretient un rapport quasi physique avec la nuit. Rien ne semble pouvoir échapper à l’emprise de la nuit. Il est souvent plus difficile d’apprécier un film en journée: même projeté dans une salle obscure, le film perd de son intensité et à la sortie, le mystère et la magie s’estompent trop vite (2016: 62).\n\nBut if the urban experience of watching movies has historically taken place in nocturnal darkness, the nocturnal city itself has been a subject of predilection for cinema since its inception; consider, for example, the early movies of Edison cameraman Edwin Porter, of the dazzling lights of the [Pan-American exhibition](https://youtu.be/Q5m6joTlnqA) or [Coney Island](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqDtG3dcxPs) at night. There is a residual sense of wonder, what David Nye calls the electrical sublime, in the nocturnal cityscapes of Molinaro and other filmmakers of his time, the “magie” of the night alluded to by Gwiadzdinski; but I would argue that by the 1950s this had been displaced by a deep ambivalence about the night as a space both of temptation, of opportunity for financial and erotic gain unavailable in the mundane light of day, but also a space of danger, or more accurately dangerous liaisons that lead to the downfall of those who embrace them.\n\nThe urban night is also the privileged chronotope of _film noir_, whether in its American, French, or British incarnations, and that night, with its deserted streets, its neon-drenched demi-monde of bars and cabarets, is the pre-eminent setting for shady goings-on of all kinds, from jewel heists to prostitution to drug deals to the disposal of bodies. But while the night provides the backdrop to such activities in _film noir_, from Fritz Lang’s _The Woman in the Window_ (1944) to Jules Dassin’s _Night and the City_ (1950), it takes on a particularly luminous resonance in the French cinema of the 1950s, from the films of Melville, as we have seen, to Louis Malle’s _Ascenseur pour l’échafaud_ (1958), with its famous sequence of Jean Moreau prowling the Parisian streets in search of her missing lover, accompanied by Miles Davis’s muted trumpet.\n\nAlthough less common in _film noir_ than is often assumed, jazz soundtracks are a key component of nocturnal cinema, in part because of the music’s own associations with nocturnal entertainment. Not only Miles Davis, but many other American jazz musicians performed in Paris in the late 1950s, including Donald Byrd, Thelonious Monk, and Art Blakey, in addition to musicians already based there such as René Urtreger, Franco-American Barney Wilen, and Algerian-born Martial Solal. Various permutations of these musicians were tapped to write soundtracks for French films: Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers for Molinaro’s _Des Femmes disparaissent_ and Roger Vadim’s _Les Liaisons dangereuses_; Monk also for _Les Liaisons dangereuses_; Barney Wilen and Kenny Dorham for _Un témoin dans la ville_; Martial Solal for Godard’s _À bout de souffle_.\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/692800866?h=6d37ed9a54&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"320\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n:::\n\nIt is, however, in the nocturnal cinema of Édouard Molinaro that the aesthetic resonance of the urban night reaches its fullest expression; so tangible does its presence become that one would be hard put to find a better example of Gwiazdzinski’s point that cinema has transformed the night into a character in its own right. While not all the action of _Le dos au mur_ and _Un témoin dans la ville_ takes place at night, so rare are the glimpses of daylight that one could easily assume that both films take place entirely after dark. In _Des femmes disparaissent_, even those fleeting glimpses of daylight disappear in a film whose setting is exclusively nocturnal.\n\n_Le dos au mur_ opens with a staple noir motif: the disposal of a body. Late at night, somewhere on the outskirts of Paris, a man wearing the signature trenchcoat and fedora exits a mansion and drives in to the city and enters a first-floor apartment, where to our surprise the murder has already taken place. Turning off a still-running shaver in the bathroom, the man wraps up the body of the dead man lying on the floor in a large rug and carries it to his car. He then drives to a nearby construction site and laboriously disposes of the body by mixing concrete, hoisting the carpet-wrapped body up onto scaffolding, and entombing it in a large wall that, it later emerges, happens to be adjacent to his office building. The rest of the film is an extended flashback that explains the circumstances that led up to this bizarre opening over the preceding three months.\n\nIn _Des femmes disparaissent_, a man stumbles upon a human-trafficking network run by an organization of businessmen that enshares young women with promises of jet-set lifestyles, after his fiancée becomes one of its latest would-be recruits. Captured by one of the organization’s henchmen, he manages to escape with his fiancée only for the couple to be recaptured after being betrayed by one of the organization’s accomplices. The film culminates in an extended shootout at the organization’s country mansion, the liberation of the abducted women, and our hero delivering a richly-earned beating to the organization’s leader.\n\n_Un témoin dans la ville_ starts out with not one but two staged suicides: a man who murders his mistress by pushing her off a train escapes prosecution by claiming she committed suicide, only to become himself the victim of a staged suicide when he is murdered one night soon afterwards by the woman’s ex-husband, Ancelin. As Ancelin slips out of the first’s house, however, he runs into a driver for a fleet of radio taxis waiting outside, whom the man he has just murdered had ordered earlier. The rest of the film depicts Ancelin’s constantly frustrated efforts to eliminate the witness, and ultimately his own pursuit by the fleet of taxi drivers and the police. The pursuit culminates at the Jardin d’Acclimatation in the Bois de Boulogne and includes eerie cutaways of startled birds and animals.\n\nThe three films share many of the signature elements of _film noir_: perfect crime gone wrong; trench-coated, fedora-wearing male protagonists; alluring female protagonists; expressionistic lighting with unmotivated shadows; deep focus; and in two of the films, a jazz soundtrack. All three films make extensive use of musical cues to underscore their nocturnal sequences: _Le dos au mur_ opens with Richard Cornu’s conventionally melodramatic orchestral score, although the rest of the sequence unfolds in a tense silence. In _Un témoin dans la ville_, after the initial trauma of the train sequence, the relaxed down-tempo of Barney Wilen’s saxophone suggests a return to some semblance of normality as the murderer arrives at the public prosecutor’s office to confirm the dismissal of his case as a _non-lieu_. By contrast, Art Blakey’s heartbeat-like drum figure at the opening of _Des femmes disparaisent_ creates a sense of ominous suspense from the outset.\n\nBut it is their characterization of the urban night that accounts for much of the films’ aesthetic appeal. In each, the night is a space not of total darkness but partial illumination, lit by the myriad light sources of the nocturnal city: the glow of street lights and the neon signs of bars, cafes, and advertisements; floodlit buildings and monuments; the dazzling displays of movie theater marquees; the mesmerizing patterns of automobile headlamps; even (in _Le dos au mur_) portable flashlights. The term _incandescent_ refers to the emission of light by an object as a result of being heated, derived from the Latin verb _incandescere_, to glow white. From this standpoint, Molinaro’s film can be described not just as a nocturnal but an incandescent cinema, its darkness illuminated by lights that burn with white-hot intensity.\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/692810185?h=6d37ed9a54&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"320\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n:::\n\nThis aesthetics of incandescence is not unique to Molinaro’s films, and is in fact one of the historical particularities of the city of Paris itself. Popularly known as the City of Light, or _ville lumière_, since the late seventeenth century, Paris was one of the first European cities to install a system of street lighting, but not for aesthetic or commercial purposes. As is well known, the measure was made at the instigation of the police in response to a rising nocturnal crime wave:\n\n> Gilbert Nicolas de la Reynie, alors nommé tout premier lieutenant général de police de Paris, en mars 1667, décida d’enrayer la criminalité grandissante dans la ville en mettant en place un éclairage public dans les rues, ruelles et impasses afin de dissuader les rôdeurs et criminels d’agir en tout impunité. Les premières lanternes d’éclairage public sont ainsi installées dans la ville de Paris et quelques mois après l’ordonnance, 2,736 lanternes à mèche charbonnée sont posées et 912 rues éclairées dans Paris ([“Ville-lumière: vestiges insolites”](https://breves-histoire.fr/thematique/ville-lumiere/), _Brèves d’Histoire_, no date).\n\nTwo and a half centuries later, a young Transylvanian journalist named Gyula Halász who had moved to Paris in 1924 became entranced by the nocturnal incandescence of the _ville lumière_ and its nightlife, and began documenting them in photography and writing. The collection of sixty black-and-white photographs of the city assembled in his 1932 book _Paris de nuit_ (1932), under the pseudonym of Brassaï (derived from the town of his birth, Brassó, in what was then Hungary), have since become an inseparable part of the city’s visual iconography, available from the postcard stands of countless newspaper kiosks and museum gift shops. The impact of Brassaï’s luminous images of nocturnal Paris on the stylization of the night in French _film noir_ several decades later is readily apparent, nowhere more so than in the films of Édouard Molinaro. Their most obvious element in common is their monochromatic nature, at a time when black and white cinematography was coded either as a signifier of neorealism or a stylistic element of _film noir_ and horror movies, in opposition to the garish Technicolor of Hollywood musicals. While in Brassaï’s photography the interplay of shadows and light serve a primarily aesthetic purpose, however, in Molinaro’s films it takes on a more specifically symbolic dimension, as a metaphor for the equally high-contrast moral world that the characters inhabit. _“Quelle nuit!”_, the characters repeatedly exclaim in _Le dos au mur_, referring not just to the fact that it’s dark out but to the disturbing events taking place within it. In this world, light represents the ontological security of the social order and its institutions, literally shining the light on criminal activity and driving back the forces of darkness.\n\nIn the climactic sequence of _Un témoin dans la ville_, the criminal is pursued into the Jardin d’Acclimatation by a a driver, by whom he is shot but then manages to overpower. Climbing over a gate, he appears to have eluded his pursuers yet again, only to be suddenly dazzled by the headlights of a fleet of encircling police cars. Finally exposed, he collapses under a hail of police bullets, and the film’s closing long shot shows his prone body spotlighted by the vehicles’ headlights as the police close in. No longer concealed by nocturnal shadows, the criminal has finally been brought into the light of justice. FIN.\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/689917054?h=81cb58f754\" width=\"320\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n:::\n\nWhile the monochromatic nocturnal cityscapes of Molinaro’s films are indebted to Brassaï’s mythologization of nocturnal Paris, however, they also add two crucial cinematic elements to it: motion and music. Other than murder, double-crossing, and abduction, one of the most prominent activities in Molinaro’s nocturnal films is driving: more specifically, night driving. Molinaro’s characters spend considerable time driving back and forth around the city, frequently in pursuit of one another. Collisions are common: cars are as much weapons as revolvers, and can be used to take down fleeing witnesses, or simply crashed into the vehicles of escaping criminals. The entire narrative of _Un témoin dans la ville_ revolves around a fleet of radio taxis, a historical novelty in the late 1950s that motivates the film’s extended car-chase sequences when the entire fleet is mobilized in pursuit of the murderer of the taxi driver. These taxis and other cars all carry unseen cameras, of course, and as such they become vehicles for the films’ extended tracking shots of the illuminated cityscape, of which they themselves are an integral part. Close-ups of headlights being switched on before cars speed away are ubiquitous; driver POV and rear-window shots show drifting bokeh patterns of blurred light, heightened during chase sequences.\n\nThe centrality of the automobile as a vehicle for exploring the night is far from limited to Molinaro’s films, of course; even in scenes of noctambulation, such as Jeanne Moreau’s celebrated _ballade_ in _Ascenseur pour l’échafaud_, she spends most of her time staring at cars in the hope of spotting her missing lover.\n\nThe jazz soundtracks of Molinaro’s films can be seen as homologous (in Paul Willis’s sense) with their visual elements. For all its experimentation with chromatic scales, in its visual representations jazz has always been a monochromatic music: the entire iconography of bebop prior to the 1970s consists of black-and-white photographs of Bird, Billie Holiday, Monk, Miles, Coltrane, and many more; the titles of jazz tunes are littered with references to shadows and light; while the black/white opposition even extends to the dynamics of race in the history of the music itself, in the systemic harassment of and often violence against black musicians by white law enforcement; and on the other hand the embrace of Harlem jazz by Norman Mailer’s hipster “white negro”.\n\nThe nocturnal cityscape takes on a very different look in the extended chase sequence from Louis Malle’s comedy _Zazie dans le métro_ (1961), which as one critic has noted is a far cry from the dark mood and themes of _Ascenseur pour l’échafaud_ two years earlier. By now the _film noir_ car chase sequence has already become an object of parody, and in contrast to the monochrome of Malle’s earlier film, his use of Kodak’s Eastmancolor stock for _Zazie_ looks suddenly garish and enhances its cartoonlike look. Much the same can be said of Jacques Météhen’s hectic jazz score. Yet even in the mode of pastiche, the sequence again provides an animated portrait of _Paris nocturne_.\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/689921450?h=286ea23f7b&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" width=\"320\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Zazie dans le m&amp;eacute;tro (1960)\"></iframe>\n:::\n\n### Night Driving\n\nOver the decade from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s, the stylistic elements of a nocturnal cinema gradually come into view in French _film noir_ and the _nouvelle vague_ like a developing Brassaï photograph. By the time we get to _Le départ_ (1967), the photograph is complete. Directed by Polish auteur Jerzy Skolimowski and shot in Brussels rather than Paris in this case, the film stars _nouvelle vague_ icon Jean-Pierre Léaud as a car-obsessed hairdresser and a score by Polish jazz musician Krzysztof Komeda. As early as the opening credits, the picture is in place: the black-and-white cinematography, even in 1967; the jazz; and the car, shot from the rear of a preceding vehicle and transformed from a mundane taxi into a flashy white Porsche, plunging towards us through the incandescent swirl of streetlights. From Melville to Skolimowski, then, the cinematic romance of the nocturnal city as a space of temptation and danger.\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/689919745?h=931ae7ab38&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" width=\"320\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Le d&amp;eacute;part (1967)\"></iframe>\n:::\n\n### Nocturnal Panoramas\n\nIn the tradition of Baudelaire and Walter Benjamin’s archetypal painter of modern life, the _flâneur_, numerous books have been written about the experience of exploring the city after dark by walking around it. From Surrealist _flâneurs_ to Situationist psychogeographers and their post-millennial descendants, there remains a pedestrian insistence (in every sense of the term) that the city is most profoundly experienced _on foot_. The psychogeographic literature on the urban night reproduces this ideology in its romanticization of _noctambulation_, or wandering the city at night. Cinema, for its part, is densely populated both by diurnal and nocturnal _flâneurs/-euses_, from Jeanne Moreau in _Ascenseur à l’échafaud_ and Antonioni’s _La Notte_ to David Hemmings in _Blow Up_. Yet the nocturnal cinema of Édouard Molinaro shows that the cinematic experience of the urban night has taken place as much from behind the wheel as on sidewalks, and typically involves more goal-oriented activities than psychogeographic research. I have come across only one psychogeographic film that involves driving rather than walking, Chris Petit and Iain Sinclair’s Ballardian homage to the M25 motorway, _London Orbital_ (2002), but a growing number of recent films involve exploring the city by night from a moving vehicle (Jonathan Glazer’s science-fiction film _Under the Skin_ (2012) comes to mind). In the postmodern megacities of the twenty-first century, it is more often from the freeway, as passengers or drivers, that we experience, and marvel at, the nocturnal panoramas of Los Angeles, Tokyo, Montréal, and the Ville Lumière itself. While the automobile arguably offers a more practical way of navigating such extended urban spaces, however, it also does more than this: viewing the panoramic nocturnal cityscape scrolling past through the frame of a car windshield or window transforms it into a cinematic experience; it feels like watching a movie. Films such as the aptly-titled _Drive_ (2011) explicitly play on this cinematic dimension of night driving, but it is equally ubiquitous in contemporary videogames and music videos. Collectively, they attest to the continuing ambivalence about the nocturnal city as a space of libidinal excess and dangerous liaisons.\n\n* * *\n",
